* Phase 11: Scheduler Reliability Fix (February 2026)

** 2026-02-10: Playlist Scheduler Retry Logic
- *Lead*: Glenn Thompson / Cascade
- Diagnosed intermittent playlist scheduler failures on production
- Root cause: Liquidsoap telnet commands via =nc -q1= silently failing
  - =liquidsoap-command= catches all errors and returns error strings
  - Scheduler =handler-case= never triggered because no CL error was raised
  - Playlist file updated correctly but Liquidsoap never switched playback
- Fix: Added =liquidsoap-reload-and-skip= with robust retry mechanism
  - Sends =stream-queue_m3u.reload= before skip (belt-and-suspenders)
  - Retries both reload and skip up to 3 times with 2-second delays
  - =liquidsoap-command-succeeded-p= validates command responses
  - Clear logging of each attempt for diagnostics
- New playlists added: =solar-flare.m3u=, =ceres-rising.m3u=
