#+TITLE: Asteroid Radio - Docker Streaming Setup
#+AUTHOR: Asteroid Radio Team
#+DATE: 2026-01-26

This setup provides a complete streaming solution using Docker with Liquidsoap and Icecast2.

* Quick Start

1. *Ensure you have music files in the =./music/= directory*
2. *Start the streaming services:*
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   ./start-streaming.sh
   #+END_SRC

* What's Included

- *Icecast2*: Streaming server (port 8000)
- *Liquidsoap*: Audio processing and streaming client
- *Automatic playlist*: Randomized playback from =./music/= directory
- *Multiple stream qualities*: 128kbps and 64kbps MP3 streams
- *Audio processing*: Normalization, crossfading, metadata handling

* Stream URLs

- *High Quality (128kbps)*: http://localhost:8000/asteroid.mp3
- *Low Quality (64kbps)*: http://localhost:8000/asteroid-low.mp3

* Admin Interfaces

- *Icecast Admin*: http://localhost:8000/admin/
  - Username: =admin=
  - Password: =asteroid_admin_2024=

- *Asteroid Web Interface*: http://localhost:8080/asteroid/
  - Username: =admin=
  - Password: =asteroid123=

* Manual Commands

** Start Services
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker compose up -d
#+END_SRC

** Stop Services
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker compose down
#+END_SRC

** View Logs
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f liquidsoap
docker compose logs -f icecast
#+END_SRC

** Restart Services
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker compose restart
#+END_SRC

** Control Liquidsoap via Telnet
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
telnet localhost 1234
#+END_SRC

Common telnet commands:
- =help= - Show available commands
- =request.queue= - Show current queue
- =request.push /path/to/file.mp3= - Add specific file to queue
- =var.get volume= - Get current volume
- =var.set volume 0.8= - Set volume (0.0 to 1.0)

* File Structure

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
asteroid/docker/
├── docker-compose.yml          # Docker orchestration
├── Dockerfile.liquidsoap       # Simple Dockerfile using official image
├── icecast.xml                # Icecast2 configuration
├── asteroid-radio-docker.liq   # Liquidsoap script for Docker
├── start.sh                   # Simple start script
├── stop.sh                    # Simple stop script
├── docker-streaming.org        # This documentation
└── setup-complete.org         # Setup summary
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Configuration

** Adding Music
1. Place music files (MP3, FLAC, OGG, WAV) in your music directory
2. Update =docker-compose.yml= to mount your music directory
3. Liquidsoap will automatically detect and play them
4. Playlist reloads every hour or when files change

** Customizing Streams
Edit =asteroid-radio-docker.liq= to:
- Change bitrates
- Add more stream outputs
- Modify audio processing
- Adjust crossfade settings

** Icecast Configuration
Edit =icecast.xml= to:
- Change passwords
- Modify listener limits
- Add more mount points
- Configure logging

** Docker Image
Uses official =savonet/liquidsoap:latest= image:
- Pre-built with all audio codecs (MP3, FLAC, OGG, WAV, etc.)
- System agnostic - works on any Docker-capable system
- Maintained by the Liquidsoap team
- Fast builds - no compilation required

* Troubleshooting

** Services won't start
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Check Docker status
docker info

# Check service logs
docker compose logs
#+END_SRC

** No audio in stream
1. Verify music files exist in =./music/=
2. Check Liquidsoap logs: =docker compose logs liquidsoap=
3. Ensure file formats are supported (MP3, FLAC, OGG, WAV)

** Can't connect to stream
1. Check if Icecast is running: =docker compose ps=
2. Verify port 8000 is not blocked by firewall
3. Check Icecast logs: =docker compose logs icecast=

** Permission issues
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Fix file permissions
chmod +x start-streaming.sh
chmod 644 icecast.xml asteroid-radio-docker.liq
#+END_SRC

* Integration with Asteroid Web Interface

The Asteroid web application can be updated to show the correct streaming status by checking if the Docker services are running. The admin dashboard will show:

- *Liquidsoap Status*: 🟢 Running (when Docker container is up)
- *Icecast Status*: 🟢 Running (when Docker container is up)

* Windows/WSL Notes

This setup works in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Docker Desktop:

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Use WSL2 backend for better performance
3. Access streams via =localhost= from Windows browsers
4. File paths should use Linux format in WSL

* Production Deployment

For production use:
1. Change all default passwords in =icecast.xml=
2. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Set up proper SSL/TLS certificates
4. Configure firewall rules appropriately
5. Consider using Docker secrets for password management
