#+TITLE: Asteroid Low Orbit Playlist
#+AUTHOR: Glenn Thompson
#+DATE: 2026-01-26

* Files

- *Asteroid-Low-Orbit.m3u* - Original playlist with relative paths
- *Asteroid-Low-Orbit-DOCKER.m3u* - Ready for VPS deployment (Docker container paths)

* For VPS Deployment

The =Asteroid-Low-Orbit-DOCKER.m3u= file is ready to use on the VPS (b612).

** Installation Steps

1. *Copy the file to the VPS:*

   #+begin_src bash
   scp scripts/Asteroid-Low-Orbit-DOCKER.m3u glenneth@b612:~/asteroid/stream-queue.m3u
   #+end_src

2. *Ensure music files exist on VPS:*
   - Music should be in =/home/glenneth/Music/=
   - The directory structure should match the paths in the playlist
   - Example: =/home/glenneth/Music/Vector Lovers/City Lights From a Train.flac=

3. *Restart Liquidsoap container:*

   #+begin_src bash
   cd ~/asteroid/docker
   docker-compose restart liquidsoap
   #+end_src

** How It Works

- *Host path*: =/home/glenneth/Music/= (on VPS)
- *Container path*: =/app/music/= (inside Liquidsoap Docker container)
- *Playlist paths*: Use =/app/music/...= because Liquidsoap reads from inside the container

The docker-compose.yml mounts the music directory:

#+begin_src yaml
volumes:
  - ${MUSIC_LIBRARY:-../music/library}:/app/music:ro
#+end_src

* Playlist Contents

This playlist contains ~50 tracks of ambient/IDM music curated for Asteroid Radio's "Low Orbit" programming block.

* Notes for Fade & easilok
