#+END_SRC

* Track Upload Workflow

** Current Implementation (Manual Upload)
1. *Copy files to staging*: Place MP3/FLAC files in =music/incoming/=
2. *Access admin panel*: Navigate to =http://[IP]:8080/asteroid/admin=
3. *Process files*: Click "Copy Files from Incoming" button
4. *Database update*: Files are moved to =music/library/= and metadata extracted
5. *Automatic playlist*: =playlist.m3u= is regenerated for streaming

** File Processing Steps
1. Files copied from =music/incoming/= to =music/library/=
2. Metadata extracted using taglib (title, artist, album, duration, bitrate)
3. Database record created with file path and metadata
4. Playlist file updated for Liquidsoap streaming
5. Files immediately available for on-demand streaming

** Supported Formats
- *MP3*: Primary format, best compatibility
- *FLAC*: Lossless audio, high quality
- *OGG*: Open source format
- *WAV*: Uncompressed audio

* Icecast2 Integration

** Configuration
- *Server*: localhost:8000
- *Mount point*: =/asteroid.mp3=
- *Password*: =b3l0wz3r0= (configured in Liquidsoap)
- *Format*: MP3 128kbps stereo

** Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)

* Dependencies

** Lisp Dependencies (asteroid.asd)
- =:radiance= - Web framework
- =:r-clip= - Templating system
- =:lass= - CSS generation
- =:cl-json= - JSON handling
- =:alexandria= - Utilities
- =:local-time= - Time handling

** System Dependencies
- =icecast2= - Streaming server
- =liquidsoap= - Audio processing
- =taglib= - Metadata extraction (via audio-streams)

* Development Notes

** RADIANCE Configuration
- Domain: "asteroid"
- Routes use =#@= syntax for URL patterns
- Database abstraction via =db:= functions
- CLIP templates with =data-text= attributes

** Database Queries
- Use quoted symbols for field names: =(:= '_id id)=
- RADIANCE returns hash tables with string keys
- Primary key is "_id" internally, "id" in JSON responses

** Streaming Considerations
- MP3 files with spaces in names require playlist.m3u approach
- Liquidsoap fallback prevents stream silence
- Icecast2 mount points must match Liquidsoap configuration

* Future Enhancements

** Planned Features
- Playlist creation and management interface
- Now-playing status tracking and display
- Direct browser file uploads with progress
- Listener statistics and analytics
- Scheduled programming and automation

** Technical Improvements
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Advanced audio processing options
- Multi-bitrate streaming support
- Mobile-responsive interface enhancements

* Troubleshooting

** Common Issues
- *No audio in stream*: Check Liquidsoap logs, verify MP3 files
- *Database errors*: Ensure proper field name quoting in queries
- *Network access*: Verify WSL IP and firewall settings
- *File upload issues*: Check permissions on music directories

** Debugging
- Enable Liquidsoap debug logging: =settings.log.level := 4=
- Check Icecast admin interface for stream status
- Monitor RADIANCE logs for web server issues
- Verify database connectivity and collections
