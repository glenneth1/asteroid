#+TITLE: Asteroid Radio - Internet Radio Streaming Platform
#+AUTHOR: Asteroid Radio Development Team
#+DATE: 2026-01-26

* Overview

Asteroid Radio is a complete internet radio streaming platform built with Common Lisp, featuring a hacker-themed terminal aesthetic. The project combines the Radiance web framework with Icecast/Liquidsoap streaming infrastructure to create a full-featured music streaming platform with live broadcasting capabilities.

* Quick Start

** Docker Installation (Recommended)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/fade/asteroid
cd asteroid/docker

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Verify streams are working
curl -I http://localhost:8000/asteroid.mp3
curl -I http://localhost:8000/asteroid.aac
curl -I http://localhost:8000/asteroid-low.mp3
#+END_SRC

** Access Points
- *Web Interface*: http://localhost:8080/
- *Admin Panel*: http://localhost:8080/admin

4. *Metadata extraction*: Track information automatically extracted
5. *Stream queue*: Optionally add tracks to broadcast queue

** Library Scanning
1. Recursive directory scanning of music folder
2. Metadata extracted using taglib (title, artist, album, duration)
3. Database records created with file paths and metadata
4. Tracks immediately available for playback and streaming
5. Supports nested folder structures
