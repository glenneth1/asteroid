#+TITLE: Asteroid Radio - Growth & Listener Retention Ideas
#+DATE: December 2025
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

* Current Situation

- 3 listeners (project contributors only)
- Curated ambient/electronic playlist (Biosphere, Autechre, Four Tet, Brian Eno, etc.)
- Solid technical foundation now in place

* Why Listeners Might Not Be Sticking

** Discovery Problem

- How do people find Asteroid Radio?
- No presence on streaming directories, social media, or music communities
- "If you build it, they will come" doesn't work for internet radio

** Content Predictability

- Curated playlists can feel repetitive to regular listeners
- Same tracks in same order = listeners know what's coming
- Ambient/electronic is niche - smaller potential audience

** No "Appointment Listening"

- Nothing that makes someone think "I need to tune in at X time"
- No live shows, no special events, no schedule

** Passive Experience

- No chat, no requests, no interaction
- Listeners have no reason to engage or return

* Ideas to Explore

** Quick Wins (Low Effort)

*** Shuffle/Random Mode

- Let Liquidsoap shuffle the entire music library
- Fresh experience every time someone tunes in
- Reduces repetition fatigue
- Could offer both: "Low Orbit" (curated) and "Deep Space" (random shuffle)

*** Multiple Themed Streams

- ~/asteroid.mp3~ - Main curated ambient
- ~/asteroid-shuffle.mp3~ - Random from full library
- ~/asteroid-dark.mp3~ - Darker ambient (Lustmord, Atrium Carceri)
- Let listeners choose their vibe

*** Now Playing Integration

- Post to a Twitter/X account automatically
- Discord webhook for a music community
- Last.fm scrobbling for discoverability

** Medium Effort

*** Submit to Internet Radio Directories

- [[https://www.radio.net/][Radio.net]]
- [[https://tunein.com/][TuneIn]] (requires application)
- [[https://streema.com/][Streema]]
- [[https://www.internet-radio.com/][Internet-Radio.com]]
- These are where people actually discover internet radio

*** Discord Community

- Create a Discord server for listeners
- Bot posts now playing
- Request channel (even if manual fulfillment)
- Builds community around the station

*** Listener Requests

- Simple web form to request tracks
- Queue gets reviewed and added by admins
- Makes listeners feel heard

*** Schedule/Programming

- Even fake "shows" create structure
- "Midnight Ambient" 00:00-06:00
- "Morning Drift" 06:00-12:00
- "Afternoon Orbit" 12:00-18:00
- "Evening Descent" 18:00-00:00
- Different playlist vibes for different times

** Higher Effort (But High Impact)

*** Live DJ Sets

- Even occasional (monthly?) live sets create events
- "Tune in Saturday at 20:00 for a live set"
- Creates appointment listening
- Can be promoted in advance

*** Guest Mixes

- Invite ambient/electronic producers to submit mixes
- Cross-promotion to their audiences
- Fresh content without ongoing effort

*** Mobile App / PWA

- Make it easy to listen on mobile
- Push notifications for special events
- "Install to home screen" prompt

*** Podcast Feed

- Archive special shows/mixes as podcast episodes
- Another discovery channel
- People can catch up on what they missed

* Interface Improvements

Current UI is functional but could be more engaging:

- *Visual identity* - Logo, consistent branding, memorable aesthetic
- *Album art* - Show cover art for current track (if available in metadata)
- *Listener count display* - "X people listening now" creates social proof
- *History* - "Recently played" visible on front page
- *Schedule display* - Even if automated, show what's coming up
- *Dark mode* - Essential for ambient music listeners (probably already dark?)

* The Music Question

** Is the music the problem?

Honestly, probably not. Ambient/electronic has a dedicated audience. The issue is more likely:

1. They don't know we exist
2. There's no reason to come back vs. Spotify/YouTube

** Random shuffle pros

- Surprise factor keeps it fresh
- Showcases full library depth
- Less maintenance than curated playlists

** Random shuffle cons

- Less coherent "vibe"
- Jarring transitions possible (need good crossfade)
- Might play obscure tracks that don't fit

** Hybrid approach

- Keep curated "Low Orbit" as flagship
- Add shuffle stream as alternative
- Let listeners choose

* Recommended Priority

1. *Submit to radio directories* - Free, one-time effort, ongoing discovery
2. *Add shuffle stream option* - Technical, we can do this easily
3. *Discord server* - Free, builds community
4. *Now playing social posts* - Automated discovery
5. *Visual polish* - Album art, listener count, branding

* Metrics to Track

Once we have more listeners:

- Peak concurrent listeners (we have this now)
- Average listen duration
- Return listener rate (would need cookies/accounts)
- Geographic distribution (we have this)
- Which stream/quality is most popular

* Final Thought

The technical foundation is solid. The music is good. The problem is almost certainly *discovery* and *engagement*. People need to:

1. Find out we exist
2. Have a reason to come back

Radio directories + social presence + community = growth path.
