;;;; limiter.lisp - Rate limiter definitions for the application
;;;;
;;;; Replaces r-simple-rate's with-limitation with a fixed-window
;;;; implementation.  The upstream tax-rate updates the timestamp on
;;;; EVERY request, preventing the window from ever resetting while
;;;; polling is active.  Our define-*-with-limit macros bypass
;;;; rate:with-limitation entirely and call fixed-window-check instead.
