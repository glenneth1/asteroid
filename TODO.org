* Rundown to Launch. Still to do:

* Server runtime configuration [0/1]
- [ ] parameterize all configuration for runtime loading [0/2]
  - [ ] strip hard coded configurations out of the system
  - [ ] add configuration template file to the project

** [ ] Database [0/1]
- [-] PostgresQL [1/3]
  - [X] Add a postgresql docker image to our docker-compose file.
  - [ ] Configure radiance for postres.
  - [ ] Migrate all schema to new database.

** Page Flow [0/0]
- [ ] When a user logs in, their user profile page should become the
  root node of the app in their view.
- [ ] When the admin user logs in, their view should become the admin
  profile page which should have panels for adminstering various
  aspects of the station.
note: these two flow items probably shouldn't affect the current state
of the front-page, except where some front-page elements are not
displayed based on the user and their associated permissions.
